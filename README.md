#Train Damage Tutorial
Step by step tutorial of how to develop an application based on Appear IQ HTML5 App Framework. 

This tutorial shows how a webapp for reporting damage on a train can be implemented using the AIQ HTML5 framework. This tutorial is best suited for developers who are new to the framework and want to get started with a hands-on application example.

This tutorial is divided into six steps. Each step final code is maintained in a separate branch.
  1. Master - Initialization using the boilerplate app.
  2. Stage2 - Using DataSync to fetch a list of business documents (trains) and listing them in the home view
  3. Stage3 - Adding a second view to the application and navigating to it when clicking on a train in the home view
  4. Stage4 - Creating a new business document (train damage report) and saving it via Datasync
  5. Stage5 - Listing the damage reports for the selected train
  5. **Stage6 - Using the filtering capabilities of Application Models**
